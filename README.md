# Ml-Neural-Networks
This repository contains codes for Neural Networks in machine learning.

### Convolutional Neural Network  
* Keras is a simple-to-use but powerful deep learning library for Python. In this post, we'll build a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it to solve a real problem with Keras.  
* A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
