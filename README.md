# Ml-Neural-Networks
This repository contains codes for Neural Networks in machine learning.

### Convolutional Neural Network  
* Keras is a simple-to-use but powerful deep learning library for Python. In this post, we'll build a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it to solve a real problem with Keras.  
* A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.  

## Repository Information

* Repeository contains :  
  * _Keras Introduction Code_ : Introduction to Keras library and how to build a convolutional neural network.
  * _Cat_vs_Dog Prediction Project_ : The project uses deep learning technique that uses Keras Library to classify images by building a convolutional neural network. Project is preferred to be run in Google Collab.
